# Lesson_RestAssured

This repository contains notes and exercises related to my learning journey with Rest Assured, a powerful Java library used for testing RESTful APIs. Below are the key concepts and skills I have learned while working with Rest Assured.

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Rest Assured**
   - **Description:** I learned about the purpose of Rest Assured and how it simplifies the process of testing REST APIs in Java. I explored the advantages of using this library over other testing frameworks.

2. **Setting Up Rest Assured**
   - **Description:** I practiced installing and configuring Rest Assured in my Java projects. This included adding dependencies to my build configuration (Maven/Gradle) and setting up the necessary environment for testing.

3. **Making API Requests**
   - **Description:** I learned how to make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Rest Assured. I practiced sending requests to different API endpoints and handling responses.

4. **Validating Responses**
   - **Description:** In this section, I focused on validating API responses. I explored how to check response status codes, headers, and body content using various assertion methods provided by Rest Assured.

5. **Handling Query Parameters and Request Bodies**
   - **Description:** I learned how to send query parameters and construct request bodies for different types of requests. This included working with JSON and XML formats.

6. **Extracting Response Data**
   - **Description:** I practiced extracting specific data from API responses using Rest Assured. I learned how to parse JSON and XML responses to retrieve required information for further validation.

7. **Using Authentication**
   - **Description:** I explored how to handle various authentication methods (Basic Auth, OAuth) in API testing. I practiced sending authenticated requests to secure endpoints.

8. **Chaining Requests**
   - **Description:** I learned about chaining requests to build complex test scenarios. This included sending requests based on the data received from previous responses and managing state across multiple requests.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Description:** I practiced implementing error handling in my tests and learned how to log requests and responses for better debugging and analysis.

10. **Integrating with Testing Frameworks**
    - **Description:** I explored how to integrate Rest Assured with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG. I practiced writing structured test cases and organizing my tests effectively.
